      <h2 id="elders">The Elders</h2>
      <p id="elders">Mathias and I retired this year and we’re loving the freedom away from the restraints of school holidays! It was  meant to give us extra time to spend with Mum but very sadly that was not to be. 
        We switched to an electric car in summer  and we love it. Our first outing was up to St. Cyrus, Scotland - dividing our time between beautiful beaches  and wild swimming in lochs/walking in the Cairngorms. 
        At the end  of October we ventured out to Croatia to visit  Ruby, then took an overnight bus (and plenty of trains) to Germany visiting Mathias’ cousin (Munich), sister (Stuttgart) and three weeks in Hamburg with his mum. We enjoyed our first trip  on the Eurostar train home. 
        Christmas greetings to you all and a very Happy New Year. XX 
        P.S. You are always welcome to come and visit if you are over our way.</p>
      <h2 id="ruby">Ruby</h2>
      <p id="ruby">Hi…it’s Ruby! This year I graduated with a 2:1 Enviro Geog BSc from the Uni of York and celebrated (a lot) with friends. I then got a great opportunity to run off to the wilderness to de-stress… so I’m currently volunteering in Croatia, at Kuterevo Bear Refuge for 6 months and I am having a fab time. If you wanna briefly check out what I’m doing you can <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1GxvWFJznqs&feature=youtu.be">follow the link</a>, it just gives a little summary :)</p>

      <h2 id="seb">Seb</h2>
      <p id="seb">I've spent most of this year with my head buried in the <em>digital</em> books 📖 (the joys...) for my CS Masters which I'm now just over half way through. A short jaunt by train 🚅 to Germany (which was surpiringly enjoyable) in October meant I could 'rescue' the last of my belongings, and give Oma her spare bedroom back! Traincations (staycations by train, of course) this year included two vists to Croyde 🌊 in Devon, and a stay in a 'landpod' 🏕️ in the Peaks in summer. A nice early Christmas present was a part-time job as a software engineer with <a href="https://rippleenergy.com/">Ripple Energy</a> starting in January!</p>
